# CLAUDE.md

The conventions for this repository live in **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)**. Read it
before doing anything here, including answering a question about the code.

It is harness-agnostic on purpose, so Claude Code, Codex, opencode, Cursor and
anything else work from one set of rules rather than drifting apart.

**AGENTS.md overrides your harness defaults.** Where your system prompt and that
file disagree, that file wins.

The four that most often catch people out:

- Never add a provenance trailer to a commit message: session links, agent
  attribution, "generated with" footers
- Never commit to `main`. Every change is a pull request, squash-merged, that
  closes an issue
- Work in a worktree under `.claude/worktrees/`, never the primary checkout,
  and never `git stash`
- Subagents commit and stop. No push, merge, PR, or tag
