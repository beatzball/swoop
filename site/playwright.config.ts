//   dev      — `litro dev`, Vite serving modules from source.
//   preview  — `litro preview`, the prerendered `dist/static` that nginx
//              ships. This is the artifact production actually serves.
//
// Both matter, because the two builds are not the same program. What only
// `preview` can catch is client code whose behavior differs between them —
// anything behind `import.meta.env.PROD`, anything the minifier or the
// tree-shaker rewrites, anything that depends on being a bundled chunk rather
// than a module served from source. A `throw` inside `if (import.meta.env.PROD)`
// passes `dev` 5/5 and fails `preview` 3/5; that is the gap, and it is why this
// file has two targets.
//
// Worth being precise about the break that motivated this, because it is NOT
// an example of the above: a page module that *calls* a Node builtin at module
// scope fails BOTH targets on the current toolchain. And a builtin that is
// merely imported and never called fails neither — rolldown stubs it to an
// empty object and tree-shakes the import away, so nothing ships and there is
// nothing to catch. The `has been externalized for browser compatibility`
// warning is therefore not a reliable signal on its own; gating on it would
// have to be a build-log check, not an assertion here.
