/**
 * HTML injected into every page's <head> via routeMeta.head.
 *
 * Order matters:
 *   1. Icons — cheap, and a browser that sees them early stops requesting
 *      /favicon.ico speculatively.
 *   2. Stylesheet link — loaded asynchronously by the browser; must come before
 *      the FOUC-prevention script so --sl-* tokens are available immediately.
 *   3. Inline script — synchronous, runs before first paint to set data-theme
 *      from localStorage, preventing a flash of the wrong theme on reload.
 *
 * Per-page metadata (description, canonical, Open Graph) is NOT here — it
 * differs per route, so each page returns it as `seoHead` from pageData.
 * See src/seo.ts.
