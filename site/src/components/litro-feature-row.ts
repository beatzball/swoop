/**
 * <litro-feature-row heading="Name the first thing it does" .commands="${[...]}">
 *   <p>One short paragraph.</p>
 *   <div slot="figure">…a picture…</div>
 * </litro-feature-row>
 *
 * One row of the "what it does" section: a heading, whatever you slot in as
 * the text, an optional row of command chips, and an optional picture.
 *
 * Rows alternate sides on a wide screen. That is done with `:nth-of-type`, so
 * it needs no property and no JavaScript: put the rows next to each other and
 * the second, fourth and sixth put their picture on the left. Below 48rem
 * every row stacks, picture last.
 *
 * A row with nothing in its `figure` slot does not leave half the width empty:
 * the picture's grid track is sized `auto`, so with nothing in it the track
 * collapses. That needs no property and no JavaScript either.
 *
 * SLOTTED CONTENT IS STYLED BY THE PAGE, NOT BY THIS COMPONENT. Shadow DOM
 * styles do not reach into a slot, so the paragraph you pass in and the
 * picture you pass into `figure` keep the page's own rules. That is on
 * purpose: the picture is yours. The one exception is how wide the picture
 * is allowed to grow, which is the row's business and is set with
 * `::slotted()`.
 *
 * COLORS come from the landing page's token block. This component defines
 * none of its own. Used outside that page, define the `--nova-*` tokens it
 * reads on any ancestor: `--nova-surface`, `--nova-border`, `--nova-text`,
 * `--nova-radius`, `--nova-font-mono`.
