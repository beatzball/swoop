 * <litro-pane-grid>
 *   <litro-pane name="pages/" span="2">…</litro-pane>
 *   <litro-pane name="server/api/" span="2">…</litro-pane>
 *   <litro-pane name="LitroRouter" span="2">…</litro-pane>
 * </litro-pane-grid>
 *
 * The frame a block of `litro-pane` elements sits in: six columns, so a row is
 * either two halves (span 3) or three thirds (span 2), and any mix that adds
 * up to six.
 *
 * THE HAIRLINES ARE THE GAPS. The grid has a 1px gap filled with the border
 * color and the panes paint the ground, so what shows between two panes is one
 * rule that both of them share — not two borders sitting side by side, and not
 * a shadow. That is the whole difference between this and a card grid: cards
 * float, panes divide.
 *
 * It follows that a pane must NOT set a border of its own. If a pane looks
 * doubly ruled, that is why.
 *
 * ON A PHONE every pane takes the full width, because a third of 390px is not
 * a column, it is a word per line.
 *
 * COLORS come from the landing page's token block. This component defines none
 * of its own: it reads `--nova-border` for the rules and nothing else.
