/**
 * THE RECIPE'S OWN MARK, drawn only when a project slots none of its own.
 *
 * Nine tapered shards thrown from a root that sits off the right edge of the
 * box, spread over about 150 degrees, so the host's crop cuts the root away
 * and a reader sees the spray rather than the point it came from. Every shard
 * ends on TWO corners rather than one flat cut; that ragged end is what keeps
 * the drawing from reading as a starburst. Four knots sit out beyond them.
 *
 * The `opacity` on each path is RELATIVE shading inside the drawing, not how
 * solid the mark is on the page — that is the hero's own
 * `--nova-mark-opacity`, applied to the whole box. Alternate shards are drawn
 * lighter, so the mass has depth instead of reading as one flat silhouette.
 *
 * COLOR COMES FROM THE TOKENS. Most of it is `currentColor`, which the rule
 * for `.ejecta` sets to `--nova-text`; two shards carry `--nova-accent`. A
 * project that changes its accent recolors the mark with it and touches
 * nothing here.

/**
 * <litro-hero-nova>

 *   <section>
 *     <h1>Say what your product does, in one line.</h1>
 *   </section>
 * </litro-hero-nova>
 *
 * The hero: one screen-high pane on a deep, tinted ground, with the project's
 * mark cropped by the right edge and a soft wash of light behind it. Whatever
 * you slot in is laid over the top, and the page decides its own column — this
 * component only supplies the ground, the light, the mark and the height.
 *
 * THREE THINGS, AND NO FOURTH. Ground, wash, mark. An earlier version added a
 * star field over the ground; at the opacity that kept it from being noise it
 * was doing nothing, and at any higher one it made the ground look dusty
 * behind the type. It is gone, and the hero is better for it.
 *
 * THE MARK IS A CROP, NOT A BADGE. Its box is far wider than the space left
 * for it and it hangs off the right edge, so the host's `overflow: hidden`
 * cuts it. A reader sees part of a very large mark, the way a poster shows
 * part of a photograph — atmosphere, not a logo floating in the middle. Give
 * it your real mark at any size; the width below is what decides how much of
 * it shows.
 *
 * A DEFAULT MARK, AND YOURS REPLACES IT. With nothing in the `mark` slot the
 * slot draws its own fallback: the ejecta, below. Slot anything with
 * `slot="mark"` and the browser drops that fallback, so a project's own logo
 * is never laid over the recipe's. There is no attribute to set and no flag
 * to unset — a slotted mark wins by construction, in the server-rendered HTML
 * as much as in the browser. The wash is anchored where the mark comes in, so
 * the light has a reason to be there either way.
 *
 * NO IMAGE FILE. There is no `<img>` and no `url()` in this component, so the
 * hero costs no extra request and any project can retint it from the token
 * block alone.
 *
 * NOTHING MOVES. There is no animation, so there is no
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` rule to write — a reader who asks for less motion
 * already gets what everybody gets. Write one again if you add a moving part.
 *
 * COLORS AND HEIGHT come from the landing page's token block. This component
 * defines none of its own. Used outside that page, define the `--nova-*`
 * tokens it reads on any ancestor: `--nova-bg`, `--nova-border`,
 * `--nova-text`, `--nova-accent`, `--nova-accent-2`, and optionally
 * `--nova-hero-min` (how tall the pane is before its content makes it
 * taller), `--nova-mark-size`
 * and `--nova-mark-size-narrow` (how wide the mark is drawn, on a wide screen
 * and on a phone) and `--nova-mark-opacity` (how solid it is, which wants a
 * different value on a light ground than on a dark one).
