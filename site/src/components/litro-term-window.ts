 * </litro-term-window>
 *
 * A small terminal picture, in one of two shapes. Set `rows` and it draws a
 * list of state, age and name. Set nothing and it draws whatever you slot in,
 * which is how a shell transcript goes in: a `<pre>` with the session in it.
 *
 * IT IS A PICTURE, AND IT IS READ AS ONE. The window carries a single
 * `role="img"` and the sentence you pass as `label`, and everything inside is
 * hidden from assistive tech. So a screen reader hears one sentence rather
 * than a column of glyphs, ages and names that mean nothing read aloud in
 * order. WRITE A REAL SENTENCE: it is the only thing a reader who cannot see
 * the picture gets. An empty `label` hides the picture from assistive tech
 * altogether, which is right only if it says nothing the page has not already
 * said in words.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO A TAB STOP, because a long transcript line makes the window
 * scroll sideways and a reader with a keyboard and no pointer has no other way
 * to reach the end of the line.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE MOVES on its own. A row's badge settles only if you give it a
 * `from` state, which these rows do not.
 *
 * COLORS come from the landing page's token block. This component defines
 * none of its own. Used outside that page, define the `--nova-*` tokens it
 * reads on any ancestor: `--nova-surface`, `--nova-border`, `--nova-text`,
 * `--nova-text-dim`, `--nova-blocked`, `--nova-radius`, `--nova-font-mono`,
 * and the state tokens the badge reads.
