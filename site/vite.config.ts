/**
 * Keep the server-only modules out of the client build entirely.
 *
 * pages/docs/[slug].ts imports both of these dynamically, from inside its
 * pageData fetcher, so the browser never asks for either chunk. Vite still
 * emits them.
 *
 * For src/highlight.ts that is 921KB written into dist/, shipped in the image
 * and pushed to the CDN, for code that only ever runs at build time -- and a
 * loaded gun, because the emitted chunk keeps a real import.
 *
 * For src/image-size.ts it is worse than waste: it reads node:fs, which Vite
 * externalizes for the browser with a warning rather than an error. The build
 * still passes and the doc page renders blank.
 *
 * This config drives ONLY the client bundle (input app.ts, outDir
 * dist/client); the server is built separately by nitro and still gets the
 * real module. `apply: 'build'` keeps dev untouched.
