/**
 * Vite dev middleware
 *
 * Spins up an in-process Vite dev server (middlewareMode) and hands it every
 * request so Vite can serve the live client entry and JS/TS module graph with
 * the correct MIME type. Vite calls next() for requests it does not own (HTML
 * pages, API routes), which Nitro's router then handles normally.
 *
 * The Vite config comes from litroViteDevConfig() in @beatzball/litro, which
 * forces `base: '/'` in dev so module URLs stay clear of Nitro's `/_litro/`
 * static mount (that mount would otherwise serve a stale pre-built bundle —
 * issue #97). See that helper's docblock for the full rationale.
 *
 * Why server middleware instead of devHandlers:
 *   Nitro's DevServer.createApp() reads nitro.options.devHandlers ONCE in
 *   the DevServer constructor, before build:before ever fires. Pushing to
 *   devHandlers from any config hook is too late. Server middleware files
 *   (server/middleware/) are bundled into the worker and registered in h3App
 *   BEFORE the router, giving Vite first access to every request.
 *
 * Bundle size:
 *   Nitro's Rollup replaces process.dev with false in production builds.
 *   DCE then eliminates the entire handler body — including the dynamic
 *   import('vite') call — so vite is NOT copied to the production output.
